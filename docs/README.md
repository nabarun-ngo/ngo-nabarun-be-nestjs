## API Endpoints

### Donations

```typescript
// Create regular donation (monthly subscription)
POST /finance/donations/regular
Body: {
  amount: number,
  currency: string,
  donorId: string,        // User ID
  description?: string
}

// Create one-time donation
POST /finance/donations/one-time
Body: {
  amount: number,
  currency: string,
  donorId?: string,       // Optional for internal users
  donorName?: string,     // Required for guests
  donorEmail?: string,    // Required for guests
  description?: string
}

// Process donation payment
POST /finance/donations/:id/process-payment
Body: {
  accountId: string       // Account to credit
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Regular Donation

```typescript
// Regular donation for internal user (monthly subscription)
const donation = await createRegularDonationUseCase.execute({
  amount: 100.00,
  currency: 'USD',
  donorId: 'user-123',
  description: 'Monthly membership donation'
});
```

### Creating a One-Time Donation (Guest)

```typescript
// One-time donation from guest
const donation = await createOneTimeDonationUseCase.execute({
  amount: 50.00,
  currency: 'USD',
  donorName: 'John Doe',
  donorEmail: 'john@example.com',
  description: 'Support for community project'
});
```

### Processing Donation Payment

```typescript
// Process payment and create transaction
await processDonationPaymentUseCase.execute({
  donationId: 'donation-123',
  accountId: 'main-account-id'
});

// This will:
// 1. Mark donation as PAID
// 2. Create a DONATION transaction
// 3. Credit the account balance
// 4. Link donation to transaction
```

### Monthly Auto-Raise (Cron Job)

```typescript
// Automatically runs on 1st of every month at 00:00 UTC
// Raises all pending regular donations for active subscribers
@Cron('0 0 1 * *')
async handleMonthlyDonations() {
  // Gets all active subscriptions
  // Creates RAISED donations for each
  // Sends notification to users
}
```

## Domain Events

The module emits the following domain events:

- `DonationRaisedEvent` - When a donation is created/raised
- `DonationPaidEvent` - When a donation payment is processed
- `TransactionCreatedEvent` - When a transaction is recorded
- `ExpenseRecordedEvent` - When an expense is submitted

## Business Rules

### Donations
1. Regular donations are auto-raised monthly for active users
2. Guest donations require name and email
3. Donations must be paid before creating transaction
4. Cannot cancel paid donations
5. Failed payments can be retried

### Transactions
6. Transactions are immutable once created
7. Must link to a valid account
8. Amount must be positive
9. Reference ID tracks source entity

### Accounts
10. Cannot debit more than current balance
11. Only active accounts can receive credits/debits
12. Accounts with non-zero balance cannot be closed

### Expenses
13. Expenses require approval before payment
14. Only approved expenses can be paid
15. Payment creates transaction and debits account

## Configuration

### Cron Schedule

The monthly donation job runs on the 1st of every month at midnight UTC. To modify:

```typescript
@Cron('0 0 1 * *', {  // minute hour day month dayOfWeek
  name: 'raise-monthly-donations',
  timeZone: 'UTC',
})
```

### Currency

Default currency is USD. To change:

```typescript
// In domain models
const DEFAULT_CURRENCY = 'USD';
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run all finance module tests
npm test -- finance

# Run specific test file
npm test -- donation.repository.spec.ts

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e -- finance
```

## Dependencies

- `@nestjs/schedule` - For cron jobs (monthly donations)
- `@nestjs/event-emitter` - For domain events
- Prisma - Database ORM

## Migration

To create database tables:

```bash
# Run migration (if not done already)
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_finance_module

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Authorization**: Implement proper role-based access control
2. **Validation**: All monetary amounts validated
3. **Audit Trail**: Immutable transaction records
4. **Data Protection**: Sensitive donor information encrypted
5. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of donation endpoints
